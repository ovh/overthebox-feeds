define Package/mptcp/description
  MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) is an effort towards enabling the simultaneous use of
  several IP-addresses/interfaces by a modification of TCP that presents a regular
  TCP interface to applications, while in fact spreading data across several
  subflows. Benefits of this include better resource utilization, better throughput
  and smoother reaction to failures.
