4.  EasyCwmp install for OpenWRT Linux
======================================

EasyCwmp
========
EasyCwmp is mainly developed and tested with OpenWRT Linux platform.

Download:

Download the easycwmp-openwrt-{x}.{y}.{z}.tar.gz and then copy it to your /path/to/openwrt/package/

cd /path/to/openwrt/package/
tar -xzvf easycwmp-openwrt.tar.gz
cd ..

Build as built-in

make menuconfig   #(And then select the package as <*>)
make

Build as package:

make menuconfig   #(And then select the package as <M>)
make package/easycwmp/compile

Install:

    Build as built-in: install your OpenWRT system in your device according to the OpenWRT manuals and then  start your system and you will get easycwmp running automatically

    Build as package: copy the package to the OpenWRT system and then install it with:

opkg install

  And then run it with:

/etc/init.d/easycwmpd start

  or run it with:

/etc/init.d/easycwmpd boot

Note: If you run easycwmpd with  start command then it will send inform to the ACS containing "2 PERIODIC" event and send GetRPCMethods to the ACS. And if you run easycwmpd with boot command then it will send inform to the ACS containing "1 BOOT" event.

Note: A third party application could trigger EasyCwmp daemon to send notify (inform with value change event) by calling the command:

ubus call tr069 notify

If the EasyCwmp daemon receive the ubus call notify then it will check if there is a value changed of parameters with notification not equal to 0

microxml
========

If you got any problem related to libmicroxml when building EasyCwmp in OpenWRT, then you can use the following libmicroxml package:

cd /path/to/openwrt/package/
wget http://easycwmp.org/download/libmicroxml.tar.gz

5. EasyCwmp install for other Linux distributions:
==================================================

general
=======

easycwmp will be placed in /opt/dev/ directory. All other dependencies will be installed in /opt/git/ directory.

Configure USER and GROUP variables that we are going to use:

USER=your_user
GROUP=your_group

Create directories:

sudo mkdir -p /opt/{dev,git}
sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP /opt/{dev,git}

 

curl
====
Your distribution should already have curl development package. Use that for now.

Note: If you build libcurl with an SSL package dependency, it is recommended to build with OpenSSL since EasyCwmp was mainly tested with libcurl using OpenSSL.

The digest authentication with ACS server will not work if you build libcurl with PolarSSL.

configuration

We won’t install easycwmp, we’ll use it from /opt/dev/easycwmp/ directory. Make sure we are located there:

cd /opt/dev/easycwmp/

Because we are using this setup for development we want that all our changes are visible in our git clone. Best way to do this is to use symlinks. First create the directory where scripts are located on actual device:

sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/easycwmp/functions
sudo mkdir -p /etc/easycwmp

Then create symlinks for easycwmp scripts:

sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/scripts/easycwmp.sh /usr/sbin/easycwmp
sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/scripts/defaults /usr/share/easycwmp/defaults
sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/scripts/functions/common/common /usr/share/easycwmp/functions/common
sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/scripts/functions/common/device_info /usr/share/easycwmp/functions/device_info
sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/scripts/functions/common/management_server /usr/share/easycwmp/functions/management_server
sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/scripts/functions/common/ipping_launch /usr/share/easycwmp/functions/ipping_launch
sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/scripts/functions/tr181/root /usr/share/easycwmp/functions/root
sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/scripts/functions/tr181/ip /usr/share/easycwmp/functions/ip
sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/scripts/functions/tr181/ipping_diagnostic /usr/share/easycwmp/functions/ipping_diagnostic

then

chmod +x /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/scripts/functions/*

Also, you can create symlink for easycwmp configuration file:

sudo mkdir /etc/config
sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/config/easycwmp /etc/config/easycwmp

And finally create symlink for easycwmpd binary:

sudo ln -sf /opt/dev/easycwmp/bin/easycwmpd /usr/sbin/easycwmpd

We need to export few variables that are used in easycwmp scripts:

export UCI_CONFIG_DIR="/opt/dev/easycwmp/ext/openwrt/config/"
export UBUS_SOCKET="/var/run/ubus.sock"

Install few shell scripts from OpenWrt:

sudo mkdir -p /lib/{config,functions}
sudo wget http://pastebin.lukaperkov.net/openwrt/20121219_lib_functions.sh -O /lib/functions.sh
sudo wget http://pastebin.lukaperkov.net/openwrt/20121219_lib_config_uci.sh -O /lib/config/uci.sh
sudo wget http://pastebin.lukaperkov.net/openwrt/20121219_lib_functions_network.sh -O /lib/functions/network.sh

If everything is configured properly when you run:

bash /usr/sbin/easycwmp -–json get value Device.

You should see some output like this:

{ "parameter": "Device.DeviceInfo.Manufacturer", "fault_code": "", "value": "easycwmp", "type": "xsd:string" }
{ "parameter": "Device.DeviceInfo.ManufacturerOUI", "fault_code": "", "value": "FFFFFF", "type": "xsd:string" }
{ "parameter": "Device.DeviceInfo.ProductClass", "fault_code": "", "value": "easycwmp", "type": "xsd:string" }
{ "parameter": "Device.DeviceInfo.SerialNumber", "fault_code": "", "value": "FFFFFF123456", "type": "xsd:string" }
{ "parameter": "Device.DeviceInfo.HardwareVersion", "fault_code": "", "value": "example_hw_version", "type": "xsd:string" }
{ "parameter": "Device.DeviceInfo.SoftwareVersion", "fault_code": "", "value": "example_sw_version", "type": "xsd:string" }
{ "parameter": "Device.DeviceInfo.UpTime", "fault_code": "", "value": "429120", "type": "xsd:string" }
...

Depending on your system you might need to:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin:/sbin
sudo ln -sf bash /bin/sh

Please note that your system /bin/sh symbolic link should be pointed to the bash interpretor.

Make changes in /etc/config/easycwmp and in /usr/share/easycwmp/defaults so easycwmpd can connect to your ACS server. But before you run easycwmpd make sure that you have in another terminal running ubusd:

/usr/sbin/ubusd -s /var/run/ubus.sock

Finally run easycwmpd as root:

/usr/sbin/easycwmpd -f -b

Note: A third party application could trigger EasyCwmp daemon to send notify (inform with value change event) by calling the command:

ubus call tr069 notify

If the EasyCwmp daemon receive the ubus call notify then it will check if there is a value changed of parameters with notification not equal to 0
